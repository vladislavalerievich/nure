# Singly Linked List

A **linked list**(also just called list) is a linear collection of data elements of any type, called nodes, where each node has itself a value, and points to the next node in the linked list.The principal advantage of a linked list over an array, is that values can always be efficiently inserted and removed without relocating the rest of the list.Certain other operations, such as random access to a certain element, are however slower on lists than on arrays.

One of the important technologies of the future is the blockchain.\
The best explanation of **blockchain** I've heard is: *"blockchain is a glorified immutable linked list"*.


## Command Line Application C#
You can run the code in the [playground](https://code.sololearn.com/cdtu4Ytz4Lhu/#cs) or via Visual Studio on your machine (I used 2019).
#### Implemented the following functionality:

1.        Constructor with one parameter(number);
2.        Constructor with two parameters(number, reference to the next item);
4.        Method of adding a new element to be the first in the list;
7.        Not a recursive method of adding a new element to the list of n-them;
19.       Not a recursive method of removing all elements with a given value;
22.       Method of removing all elements with negative values;
28.       Not a recursive method of printing list items in reverse order in a string;
38.       Method of sorting list items by decreasing numeric values;
53.       Indexer with one parameter, which allows to find the serial number in the list by the value of the element;
